			SEQUENCE A 

FADE IN  NIGHT
  
MED. SHOT   DOOR OF A HOUSE   
A cheap residential district. The house has no architectural 
character; it is not certain where we are. Near the entrance 
door is a garbage can, full.

A dog is nibbling at some of the garbage. We hear whistling, 
footsteps. A garbage man comes into the picture. He shoos 
the dog away. Without pause in whistling, he lifts the 
garbage can and, followed by camera, goes to the end of the 
block, which is only a few steps. Now we discover we are in 
Venice. In the background is a major canal and a typical 
bridge--romantic background. Gondolas are passing. In the 
foreground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola, piled 
high with garbage. The man dumps his load, leaves the empty 
can on the sidewalk, gets in the gondola, and paddles away 
with the grace of a gondolier. Now, in a beautiful tenor 
voice which is quite a contrast to the garbage, he starts 
singing a passionate "

	The RKO trademark FADES OUT, to reveal a road lined with palm
	trees, spectrally long and straight like a vista in a Dali
	painting.  Along this road and from a far distance two tiny
	figures advance toward the camera.  Over this scene the TITLE
	and CREDITS are SUPERIMPOSED.  The two figures continue to
	advance, growing more discernible all the time.

	As the credits FADE, the two human figures advancing along
	the road are more clearly discernible.  Although they are not
	close enough to distinguish their faces, it can be seen that
	one of them is an enormously tall, cadaverous negro, clothed
	only by ragged, tight-fitting trousers and that the other is
	nurse, dressed in crisp white uniform and cap, with a dark
	cloak over her shoulders.
